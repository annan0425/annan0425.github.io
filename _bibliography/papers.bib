      This paper addresses the incentive misalignment in the standard Last-Click Mechanism (LCM) by modeling ad attribution as a Game-Theoretic problem. We propose the Peer-Validated Mechanism (PVM), leveraging Information Elicitation principles to enforce truthful reporting and maximize attribution accuracy while ensuring fairness.

      Honestly, I prefer this work over my Oral paper. While the other one is flashy, this one is deep. It started when I realized that the industry-standard attribution models were fundamentally broken from a game-theoretic perspective. Proving the tight bounds for this mechanism was one of the most intellectually satisfying moments of my undergraduate research.

      In contemporary e-commerce platforms, search result pages display two types of items: ad items and organic items. We address the design of a merging mechanism that satisfies Incentive Compatibility (IC) and Individual Rationality (IR). We introduce two simple and effective mechanisms, G-FIX and G-CHANGE, and theoretically prove their approximation ratios.

      This was my first foray into Mechanism Design. The challenge was to unify two completely different ranking systems (Ads vs. Organic) into one list without breaking the economic properties. It was accepted as an Oral Presentation, which was a huge encouragement for me to pursue this path further.
