        <b>Project: Beyond Last-Click: An Optimal Mechanism for Ad Attribution (NeurIPS 2025)</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Modeled ad attribution as a <b>Game-Theoretic problem</b> to address incentive misalignment in Last-Click Mechanism (LCM).</li>
          <li>Proposed <b>Peer-Validated Mechanism (PVM)</b> leveraging Information Elicitation to enforce truthfulness.</li>
          <li>Proved PVM is the optimal DSIC mechanism in homogeneous settings with tight accuracy bounds (19/27 ≈ 0.7037).</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Project: Merging Mechanisms for Ads and Organic Items (AAAI 2025 Oral)</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the first IC & IR mechanisms (G-FIX & G-CHANGE) to unify ad auctions and organic recommendations in multi-slot settings.</li>
          <li>Discovered necessary conditions for optimality and proved approximation ratios (4/5³ for G-FIX, 1/2 for G-CHANGE).</li>
