I am a senior undergraduate student at the **Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence**, **Renmin University of China (RUC)**, majoring in Artificial Intelligence (Honors Program). I rank **1st/61** in my cohort during the Sophomore & Junior years.

Currently, I am a research assistant at the **RUC-EconCS Lab**, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. [cite_start]Qi Qi](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/qiqi). My research focuses on utilizing optimization and game-theoretic mechanisms to complex systems, particularly in the areas of EconCS and Large Language Models (LLMs).

In my research, I have applied these game-theoretic principles to address real-world challenges, such as Ad Auctions and Attribution for e-commerce platforms. As the first author, I have published papers in top-tier conferences. My first paper was accepted for**Oral Presentation** at **AAAI 2025** (4.6%), and my second paper was accepted as a **poster** at **NeurIPS 2025**—which I personally find especially exciting.

Right now, I’m tackling optimization problems that involve budget constraints. I'm working on:
- **Autobidding & Budget Allocation:** How to spend money wisely in multi-channel auctions.*
- **LLM Tool Use:** Teaching LLMs to use tools under strict budget constraints. 

<span style="color:red;">**I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions starting in Fall 2026.**</span> My goal is to develop AI systems that are both powerful and economically sustainable. I am particularly interested in **optimization** and **game theory** problems arising from the rapidly growing field of **e-commerce**. Furthermore, I am particularly excited about the emerging **LLM Economy**, including **system optimization** (e.g., routing, scheduling, token allocation), **strategic multi-agent systems**, and applying LLMs to facilitate **problem formalization** and the **computation of equilibria** in complex systems.
