Hi, I'm **Nan An**.

I am a senior undergraduate in the **AI Honors Program** at **Renmin University of China (RUC)**. Currently, I am a research assistant at the **RUC-EconCS Lab**, advised by [Prof. Qi Qi](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/qiqi). My research focuses on **utilizing** optimization and game-theoretic mechanisms **to analyze and design** complex systems, particularly in the areas of **EconCS** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

My research efforts have yielded **impactful results**. I have published papers as the **first author** at top-tier conferences:
* My first paper was accepted for an **Oral Presentation at AAAI 2025** (Acceptance Rate: 4.6%).
* My second paper is a **Poster at NeurIPS 2025**, which is the **first work** to model and solve an **urgent incentive problem** in Ad attribution.

### What I'm Working On Now
I am currently extending my research into dynamic and constrained settings. My ongoing projects include:
* **Autobidding Strategies** in complex auctions.
* **Multi-channel Online Budget Allocation**.
* **Budget-constrained Tool Use** for Large Language Models.

### Looking Forward
<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions starting in Fall 2026.</span>

My goal is to build AI systems that are both powerful and **economically sustainable**. I am specifically interested in the emerging optimization and mechanism problems in two areas:
* **E-commerce Platforms:** Addressing challenges such as **online matching**, **autobidding**, and **merging mechanisms** for ads and organic items.
* **The LLM Economy:** Investigating **system optimization** (e.g., routing, scheduling), **budget-constrained multi-agent workflows**, and **pricing equilibria** in AI marketplaces.

### Honors & Awards
* **2025 National Scholarship** (Highest Honor for Undergraduates in China)
* **2024 National First Prize**, China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) (Top 0.5%)
* **2023-2025 Selected Scholarships for Academic & Research Excellence**
